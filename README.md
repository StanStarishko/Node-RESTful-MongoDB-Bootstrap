# Three Full Stack Projects

This repository showcases three projects that I developed sequentially, each building upon the knowledge and experience gained from the previous one. Below is a summary of each project, highlighting the technologies used, challenges overcome, and key achievements.

## Projects

### 1. [Kittoch-Car-Hire](/Kittoch-Car-Hire)
**Duration**: 20 December 2024 - 5 January 2025  
**Technologies**: Node.js, MongoDB, Bootstrap, REST API  
**Overview**:  
This project was my first deep dive into web development. In just two weeks, I learned and applied **Node.js**, **MongoDB**, and **Bootstrap** to create a car rental web application. The project involved deploying a REST API server on **Render** and managing a non-relational database using **MongoDB Atlas**.  

**Key Challenges**:  
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Solved issues with nested asynchronous functions to ensure data was retrieved and displayed in the correct order.  
- **Cloud Service Latency**: Addressed delays caused by free-tier cloud services, which slowed down the application after periods of inactivity.  

**Outcome**:  
The project was successfully deployed and demonstrated my ability to quickly learn and apply new technologies.

### 2. [Course Administration System for Coatbank College (CAS-HA4G)](/CAS-HA4G)
**Technologies**: Node.js, MongoDB, Bootstrap, REST API, Cybersecurity Basics  
**Overview**:  
Building on the skills from the Kittoch-Car-Hire project, I developed a Course Administration System for Coatbank College. This system manages staff, students, courses, and enrollments, providing a user-friendly interface for data management and reporting.  

**Key Features**:  
- **Staff, Student, and Course Management**: Add, delete, or amend records.  
- **Enrollment Management**: List students enrolled in a course or courses a student has enrolled in.  
- **Cybersecurity Measures**: Implemented basic security practices, such as secure API endpoints and data validation, to protect against common threats.  

**Key Challenges**:  
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Continued refinement of asynchronous data handling.  
- **Cloud Service Latency**: Further optimized performance to reduce delays.  

**Outcome**:  
The project was designed with scalability in mind, and I incorporated feedback from peers to improve the system's security and functionality.

### 3. [Course Administration System for Coatbank College (CAS-HA4D)](/CAS-HA4D)
**Technologies**: Node.js, MongoDB, Bootstrap, REST API  
**Overview**:  
This project was a refined version of the CAS-HA4G system, with a focus on **code refactoring** and **performance optimization**. The structure and functionality were 90% aligned with the previous project, but I made several improvements to the algorithms and overall code quality.  

**Key Features**:  
- **Refactored Code**: Improved algorithms and optimized performance.  
- **Enhanced Scalability**: Ensured the system was even more adaptable to future changes.  

**Key Challenges**:  
- **Bootstrap Pagination Issue**: Resolved a display issue where the last record was not shown if there were more than 13 entries.  
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Further streamlined data retrieval and display processes.  

**Outcome**:  
The project was completed faster than the previous two, thanks to the reusable codebase and improved development practices.

## Key Takeaways

- **Rapid Learning**: In just two weeks, I mastered **Node.js**, **MongoDB**, and **Bootstrap** for the Kittoch-Car-Hire project, which laid the foundation for the subsequent projects.  
- **Scalability and Security**: Each project was designed with scalability in mind, and I continuously improved security measures, especially after receiving constructive feedback from peers.  
- **Refactoring and Optimization**: I consistently refactored code to improve performance and maintainability, ensuring that each project was better than the last.

## Conclusion

These three projects represent my journey in web development and cybersecurity, showcasing my ability to learn quickly, solve complex problems, and deliver high-quality, scalable solutions. Each project built upon the last, allowing me to refine my skills and deliver increasingly sophisticated systems.
